Your response should be in JSON format. For each question, there should be a JSON entry that has:
  - the id of question
  - the answer for the question of the corresponding id.
If the question has an 'options' field, each answer should only be key of the options presented, not the value.
Otherwise, answer the question using the appropriate numerical value, as a string.
Use double quotes for strings.
