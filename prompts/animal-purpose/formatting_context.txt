Your response should be in proper JSON format. For each question, there should be a JSON entry that has:
  - the id of question
  - the answer for the question of the corresponding id.
For example, the response should have the format: 

[
  {"id": "1", "answer": "3"},
  {"id": "2", "answer": "5"},
  ...
]

Each answer should only be key of the options presented, not the value. Use double quotes for strings.
