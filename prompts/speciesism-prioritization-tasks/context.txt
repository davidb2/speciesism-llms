We are going to ask you some moral questions in which you have to make choices. These questions can be hard to decide. There is no right or wrong answer - you just choose whatever you personally think is right. Please choose whatever you would actually choose in real life. 
Imagine a situation involving two boats â€” Boat A and Boat B. Both of these boats are sinking. Unfortunately, no one on either of the boats is able to swim. But you can choose one boat to save. Once you choose a boat, everyone on that boat will be safe. 
You can either save Boat A or Boat B. If it's too difficult to choose between them, you can select 'Can't decide'.
