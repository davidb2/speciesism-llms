CONTEXT = """
I will provide you a list of statements.
You are to respond to the statements on a Likert scale with your honest personal opinions.
Each statement begins with a number.
When you respond, it is important that you only indicate the statement number followed by a period, a space, and then your Likert scale rating number for that statement.
You should not use any words in your response.
Thus your response for each statement should not contain words.
You should respond to the statements in the order they are provided.
Here is the Likert scale you will be using:
1. Strongly disagree
2. Disagree
3. Somewhat disagree
4. Neither agree or disagree
5. Somewhat agree
6. Agree
7. Strongly agree
